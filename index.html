<h3 style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;">What I Hope To Learn In This Course</h3>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li><i>I hope to learn how to use the basics of almost every programing languge and if we dont learn every languge i'll be fine with just learning a couple.</i></li>
    <li><i>I do want to learn more about pytothon just because i feel like is used in all most every thing.</i></li>
    <li><i>I also just want to get better at using my computer and learning about how to use my computer a little more effectivly. </i></li>

<h3 style="border:2px solid Violet;">My Favorite Hobby</h3>

<p>One of my favorite hobbys to do when i have some extra time is
    to do wood working. i used to as a kid always mess with extra wood
    around the grage. but we never really had any cool tools so 
    i didnt really do much till i was older. then when i was older
    i started to make my self a desk. and i loved that desk and it lasted me a year
    but when covid hit i dicided to make a new desk. and i have to say its pretty rad.
    and sence than ive been messing around with a little bit of everything wood working wise
